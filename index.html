    <p><b> Your network is your net worth.</b>
        <BR> My name is Tyler and I like to connect the dots and put plans into action, no matter the
        nature of the task at hand. I graduated from Georgia State University with a B.B.A in Marketing and I’m currently working
        as an Account Executive for Expedia, Inc. On a day to day basis I consult with numerous partners, manage accounts, conduct
        search engine marketing through various Expedia brands, execute negotiations, and do strategic planning/execution for
        the 2000+ hotels that fall under my managed territory in effort to reach/exceed my KPI’s.
